This repository and its accompanying dynamic document and Shiny app are three key components of an Open Policy Analysis (OPA) on the costs and benefits of mass deworming interventions in various settings. Together, these materials create a transparent and reproducible analysis to facilitate collaboration and discussion about deworming policy.

1 - [An interactive plot](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/simulator_app/), which summarizes the interactions between all key parameters for a given set of assumptions. Materials can be found in: [`code\shiny_app`](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-deworming/tree/master/code/shiny_app).

2 - Open policy report in the form of a [dynamic document](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/analysis/) [replace with link to deworming doc], which details all data, code, and assumptions included in the analysis. Materials can be found in: [`code\dynamic_doc`](https://github.com/BITSS/opa-wealthtax/tree/master/code/dynamic_doc).

3 - This Github repository, which stores all data, code, and materials necessary to replicate the analysis in full with minimal effort.  

This case study complies with the highest levels of the [Open Policy Analysis (OPA) Guidelines](https://www.bitss.org/opa/community-standards/). We also look to demonstrate tools, ideas, and practices through which OPA can be implemented in practice. This exercise, and future case studies, in turn will inform the Guidelines.
